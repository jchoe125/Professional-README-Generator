## Description

This app will allow the user to dynamically generate a README file using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
* THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

WHEN I enter my project title

WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
* THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
* THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

WHEN I enter my GitHub username
* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile

WHEN I enter my email address
* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
